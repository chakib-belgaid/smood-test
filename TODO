# Required 
- Add finger print 

# optional 
- Add unit tests 
- Add load balencer 


## some ideas at the first glimse 
1. finger printing 
2. [ use page routes ]
3. personification of the user - make a profile about what he likes and what he doens't like 
4. based on the personfication each product has a vectore of likely hood 
5. should google that ! 

add : average refill parameter - like i wont buy another car because i baught one however i would add complementary projects 

## ansering the questions
1. ask vikas :p 
2. Latency ? parallellisme ? kubernites 
3. add some randomization in order to sort based on the likely hood score - need to read it a little bit 
4. i sort only when i visit the page so it took it after consediration and i dont sort in the database since it is based on the profile - however i can preparre the sorting the moment the client log in and put it in a View
